# Text-Author-Analysis
The books are collected from “Project Gutenberg” website. They are free and available in text files.
The text files are edited manually to contain only the content of the book, since they have some unneccesary
information that is not useful for analysis.
There are three books for each of the author.


#### Jonathan Swift's books:
"A modest proposal", 
"Gulliver's Travels into Several Remote Nations of the World", 
"The Tale of a Tub and The History of Martin"

#### Jane Austen's books:
"Pride and Prejudice", "Emma", "Sense and Sensibility"


#### Mary Shelly's books:
"Frankenstein", "The Last Man", "Tales and Stories"


### Section 1. Map Reduce
By anlayzing their text with Map Reduce, the top most frequent words will be shown. Later in the section
2 of the project the classification of the each text's author will be shown.
For this first section, let's see how the word usage is similar or different for each author by looking
at the top word frequency for each of the books.

### Section 2. Model Classification for different authors' books
Using LSTM Neural Network to classify the authors using their books.
